#You will have to change the following four definitions

#from the default values to the correct ones, according

#to your MySQL server instance. When you installed Kippo

#and configured MySQL logging, you should have created

#a new MySQL server user just for this job.

define('DB_HOST', 'localhost');

define('DB_USER', 'username');

define('DB_PASS', 'password');

define('DB_NAME', 'database');

define('DB_PORT', '3306');



#The following value determines whether Kippo-Graph would

#automatically check if a newer version is available for download.

#You can inspect the function at include/misc/versionCheck.php.

#It works by comparing the latest version number that resides

#in a text file uploaded on Kippo-Graph's website against the

#'VERSION' definition inside versionCheck.php. If the local

#number is lower than the online/remote one, you get the message.

#While in theory you can trust the remote website, I realise that

#you might think this procedure poses a risk to the privacy of

#your honeypot's IP address, because it is being transmitted and

#logged while retrieving the remote text file. For this reason,

#the following value ensures that having the update checking

#feature enabled is your choice and not forced.

#Change NO to YES if you want to enable it.

define('UPDATE_CHECK', 'NO');
